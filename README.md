It's a platform scroller in which the difficulty level increases as the user climbs up a tower, the motivation for the user is self improvement, enemies drop equipment which can be used to slay better enemies that drop more effective equipment. My inspiration for creating this project stems from "The Realm of the Mad God" video game that had players inspired by only their own improvement. Recreating this in my own project would be very fulfulling.

## Aims
This software is produced by me, an individual developer, for the purposes of self improvement. Below is a list of aims that I hope this project will help me achieve:

* Revive the ambition for a video game concept I enjoy.
* Improve my ability to create different enemy NPC patterns.
* Implement static maps that both NPC and Users can traverse.
* Develop an interactive inventory system.
